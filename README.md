Task 1 :
      
    All in on digital transformation: Creating a stronger, nimbler, more resilient future! 

    We aim to build innovative technology solutions that differentiate us from our competitors and digitise the business.
    Part of that included a strategic decision to invest in upskilling programmes so our people could learn how to use 
    digital tools for data visualisation as well as automation, data cleansing and more. <br>
    
      If our people could use these tools to solve common problems, they’d help us become more efficient and growth-oriented<br>
      now and more innovative later in Business Services and beyond. Now, employees are learning to build bots – over<br>
      2,400 have been created so far – to automate workflows. We continue to invest to make processes more intuitive using<br>
      machine learning, PowerBI and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). These are key to working faster and solving<br>
      problems differently for ourselves and our clients. <br>
    
    This is why you're here! Our Digital Accelerator programme is an internal chance that takes groups of our employees<br>
    out of their day jobs and puts them through  trainings that teaches them skills in technology such as automation,<br>
    machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is an important part of it as visualising data <br>
    helps to handle and understand clients. <br>
    
    So, become a Digital Accelerator yourself and start your PowerBI journey with us! <br>
